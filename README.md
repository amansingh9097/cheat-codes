# everyday-hacker-scripts
=========================

everyday-hacker-scripts is a collection of various scripts written in Python that makes my day to day tasks easier. If you are a lazy computer user (like me) and want things done just with a single command from your command line, this is the repository for you. The scripts here currently supports Linux, UNIX and WINDOWS OS.

### Usage
---------

Using these scripts is pretty straight forward. You just need to have Python 3.x or higher and the libraries mentioned out in the `requirements.txt`.

### Contributing
----------------

All contributions are welcomed. You can fork the repo and add your own scripts (written in Python3) or bug fixes and make a pull request.
